 *  c - 6 bits, capacitance, how much capacitance is detected.
 *              Seems to be highest around a ring inside the wheel
 *              circle, decreasing the farther the finger is from
 *              that ring
 *  a - 12 bits, angle, the angle of the wheel where touch is sensed
 *               the upper 4 bits are 'f' when the touch is at the
 *               top of the wheel (12 o'clock), and loops back to 0.
 *               Increased in a clockwise direction.
 *  p - 1 bit,  pressed, is the wheel being touched in the center.
 *
 *  Multitouch is not supported.  If one or more fingers are added to
 *  a first one that's touching, the reported angle will stay the same
 *  but the capacitance and center press may change.
 *
 *
 * Scroll Sensor packets
 *  Same as scroll wheel, except the 'a' angle is now position, with
 *  lower values to the right and higher values to the left, and 'p'
 *  now indicates whether a spot on the bezel about 0.5cm left of the
 *  sensor is being touched.  There is no indication on the bezel where
 *  this spot is.  Unlike the wheel, it is very possible for 'p' to be 1
 *  and both 'c' and 'a' to be 0. (Although they may not be if both this
 *  spot and the sensor are being touched simultaneously.)
